# MANOS
MANOS is an innovative project designed to create a highly modular and scalable autonomous system using ROS 2. It leverages the decentralized architecture of ROS 2 to enhance system robustness, fault tolerance, and flexibility. This system is particularly suited for robotics applications that require high levels of reliability and responsiveness.
